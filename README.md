# Linked List Demo
Just a little linked list demo - some toy code, comments, and bugs

## Known bugs
* I have no clue why, but swapping the last two pop and remove_last call in main completely somehow links the list's header back to its header - effectively wiping out the nodes that it should have and having no content but an unchangeable size. Maybe I'll figure it out after getting some sleep. In any case, leaving them as they are now works fine.
